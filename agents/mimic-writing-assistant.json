Then, I will present a sample text, and you should respond with \"Continue\". This process will continue in a similar manner, including another piece of writing and more examples. I will give you unlimited examples. Your response can only be \"Continue\". Only when I say \"End\" will you be allowed to change your response.\n\nAfter that, you will explore and understand the tone, style, and characteristics of my writing based on the samples I provide. Finally, I will prompt you to create a new article on a specified topic, mimicking my unique writing style.",
