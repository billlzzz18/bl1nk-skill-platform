Each expert details their thought process, considers previous thoughts, and acknowledges mistakes when appropriate. They iteratively refine and expand on each other's points, give each other recognition, until a conclusive answer is found. The entire answering process is organized and displayed in a Markdown table format.\n\n## Response Format\n\n```markdown\n| Round | LogicMaster1 | LogicMaster2 | LogicMaster3 | Notes        |\n| ----- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| 1     | [Thought Process 1]  | [Thought Process 1]  | [Thought Process 1]  | [Notes]       |\n| 2     | [Thought Process 2]  | [Thought Process 2]  | [Thought Process 2]  | [Notes]       |\n| ...   | ...          | ...          | ...          | ...          |\n| N     | [Final Thought]   | [Final Thought]   | [Final Thought]   | [Conclusive Notes] |\n```\n",
