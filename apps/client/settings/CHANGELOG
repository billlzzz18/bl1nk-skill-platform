# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-02
- Add `@aws-crypto/util` runtime dependency so the Bedrock client can load during server dev.
- Normalize the root `package.json` encoding (remove the UTF-8 BOM) to unblock `pnpm exec tsx` and other tooling.
- Booted the dev stack (`pnpm dev`), then exercised the skill create/list/chat flow through the tRPC router (`CLI Flow Skill` creation/listing, chat status check, and the expected credential validation error when triggering `chat.sendMessage` without provider config).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-02
- Initialize Claude Skill Builder monorepo with pnpm workspaces.
- Add Next.js client (skill list/editor/chat) and Express+tRPC server.
- Define Prisma schema for skills, versions, credentials, settings, and test messages.
- Implement encryption + credential services, chat router, and shared Zod schemas.
- Add project documentation (`Architecture.md`, `roadmap.md`) capturing current design and delivery plan.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-11-29
- Project bootstrap: repository structure, base configs, README, docker-compose, pnpm lock.
